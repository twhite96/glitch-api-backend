# Glitch API Backend for Faker Data App

> A small API using Node and Express to generate random user profiles from Faker.js

## Motivation for this API
Basically, I just wanted to try my hand at building a simple API instead of some API I'd build from some tutorial. I googled a couple things and drew off my knowledge of building [YelpCamp](https://github.com/twhite96/YelpCamp), the final project from Colt Steele's The Web Developer Bootcamp.

Simple enough and was built in a day.

## Stack
I decided to stick with the stack I am more familiar with: Node.js and Express.js. Hosting on Glitch meant that it would be easy to get spun up and it was *free* so that made it a no brainer for me. Faker.js was the most logical choice to grab data for a proof-of-concept API.

## Challenges
None really; just needed to Google Faker.js and syntax. The rest went smoothly.

## Next steps
I'd like to build an API with Rails at some point, just because it is still used and semi-popular.
